          I am a Computer Science student in my final semester at North Carolina State University. I have verbally 
          accepted a job with <a href='https://sollers.eu' target=_blank>Sollers Consulting</a> as a software developer in Warsaw, Poland.
          Currently, I consider my specialities to be focused in backend development, with a concentration in Cybersecurity.
          My two major aspirations as a programmer are to refine my skills in front-end development in order to be a true
          full stack developer, and to move to a software engineering role opposed to just a software developer.

          <br><br>
          Aside from programming, I have several hobbies that I am very passionate about. I am the type of personality that
          enjoys building on long projects over time and cultivating progress through patience and investment. The greatest 
          hobby of mine is learning languages. I speak english, french, and polish, and I have ideas of beginning either
          russian or german in the near future. All translations on this site are done by me (translated pages not implemented yet).
          <br><br>
          My second major hobby is the sport of powerlifting. Videos of my lifting can be found 
          <a href='https://www.instagram.com/isnotdavid/' target=_blank>here</a>. My current best lifts are a 210kg squat, 135kg bench press, and 230kg deadlift.
          My goal in powerlifting is to qualify for the European Championship in the <a href='https://www.europowerlifting.org/' target=_blank>EPF</a>.
